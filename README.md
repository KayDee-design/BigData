# BigData
## Introduction 
The rapid rise of social media has revolutionized the way information is disseminated and consumed, particularly in countries like Bhutan where traditional media once held a near-monopoly on news delivery. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have evolved into essential news sources, offering real-time updates and enabling user interaction with national developments. This transformation presents a unique opportunity to understand how Bhutanese citizens engage with current events online.
As users increasingly comment, share, and react to news posts, a massive volume of unstructured data is generatedâ€”offering a rich source for sentiment analysis and behavioral insights. However, extracting meaningful patterns from this data requires scalable and efficient processing techniques. Big Data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark make it possible to process large-scale datasets collected from social media platforms. This project harnesses these technologies to analyze Bhutanese news content and public sentiment, with the aim of uncovering insights into how news is perceived and discussed in the digital age.

Objectives 	
- Assess Public Sentiment: To evaluate the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of Bhutanese news shared on social media platforms.
- Identify Key Themes and Topics: To identify the main themes and topics that resonate with the public based on social media discussions surrounding Bhutanese news.
- Visualize Sentiment Trends: To track and visualize sentiment trends over time, offering actionable insights that can inform media strategies, public discourse, and policymaking.
